# Beanstalk
  A statically typed language designed for idiots like me and you. Centralize your logic, templates, styling and content for websites, webapps and servers. 

  Imagine if HTML, CSS and JS were combined into one language with all the hindsight of modern web development and language design.

  Cutting through the web development BS one .bs file at a time.

### Principles:
- Fun and fast DX
- Consistent and minimal syntax
- Seamless all-in-one language for components, content, client side or server code and configuration files
- Powerful compile time control
- Keywords make intuitive sense to beginners
