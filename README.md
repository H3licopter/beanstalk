# beanstalk
  A statically typed language designed for idiots like me and you. Designed to centralize logic, templates, styling and content for websites, webapps and servers. 

  Imagine if HTML, CSS and JS were combined into one language with all the hindsight of modern web development.

  Cutting through the web development BS one .bs file at a time.

### Principles:
- Fun
- Consistent and minimal syntax
- Seamless all-in-one language for components, markdown, scripts and configuration files
- Expression based with a focus on method chaining
- Keywords make intuitive sense to beginners
