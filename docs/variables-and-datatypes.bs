# Variables
Equals '=' is used for variable assignment. And colon : is used to indicate initialisation. If a variable is assigned a value with a colon rather than the equals symbol it becomes immutable.

# Static Assignment
{raw:
    my_brain : string = "Dumb"

    --type is inferred as i64
    number_4 : int = 69 

    -- dynamically infer the type at compile time
    my_brain := "thing" 
}

*There is no such thing as Nil or Null in Beanstalk.*
Variables initialised with a type but no assignment will have a zero value depending on the type.
If an error occurs during assignment of a variable, 
the zero value will be used and an error will be created as an additional value that must be handled during the assignement or passed up the callstack.

{raw:
    uselessness: int --value is 0

    thing :: a_collection -- Immutable reference
    thing := a_collection -- mutable reference
    thing := a_collection.copy() -- deep copy, inherits type

    number : int = 30.0
    number_copy := number 
}

# Immutable Variables
{raw:
    -- Int constant (type inferred at compile time)
    self_worth :: 0

    -- Float constant
    my_iq :: 0.0

    best_number : int : 69

    -- Int constant evaluated at compile time
    weird_num :: 69 ** 420
}

If you are creating a non-collection variable and need it to be formatted over multiple lines, you can wrap the value in brackets

{raw:
    var1, var2, var3, var4 : int : (
        4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10
    )

    var1, var2 : int : 420

    var3, var4 := "cool", "beans"
}

# Data Types
All data type keywords contain methods from the standard library for common manipulation of types. 
The zero value is the value a variable will be assigned if it is not assigned a value when being initialized.

{table 3:
    {: Type} {: Description} {: Zero Value}
    {: int} {xcol: These numerical types are 64 bit by default but support custom sizes} {xcol: 0}
    {: number } 
    {: decimal} {: A precise number of any size. Memory inefficiency and slower calculation speeds in ex change for precision}
    {: string} {: UTF-8} {: ""}
    {: rune} {: Unicode char (rune) is like an Int32} {: 0}
    {: bool} {: Including true and false as types} {: false}
    {: scene} {: The templating syntax of Beanstalk} {xcol: []}
    {: []} {: Collection}
    {: choice} {: Rust style enums} {xcol 2: error}
    {: type} {: For creating new objects}
    {: error} {: Contains a string detailing the error}
}

Type will operate as a generic when specified as the type of a function arg. 
It's also used for creating Objects and choices, using the same syntax as creating constant variables.

# Strings
String is the keyword for string types in Beanstalk. Double quotes are automatically UTF8 strings. 

"Double quotes for a utf8 string literal"

Curly braces are used to add expressions into the string. 

{raw:
    "9 is {5 + 4}" -- 9 is 9
}

Backticks are used for RAW strings. To escape a backtick it must be preceded with a backslash \.

"string literal with \{curly braces} in it that is escaped" 

{raw:
    `9 "is" {5 + 4}` -- 9 "is" {5 + 4}
}

# Runes
Rune characters are equivalent to Int32 but are their own specific type. 

cool_emoji : rune: ðŸ˜‚

# Strict Types
Variables can also have additional contraints about their types, allowing only valid matches to be assigned at compiletime or runtime without an error being thrown. 

These constraints can be added to the type portion of the variable assignemnt.
Doing this allows a small, clean syntax for handling invalid inputs using Beanstalks error handling.


{raw:
    person_age : int 0 to 120 = $age_input.value !(
        print("Invalid age input: {error}")
    )
}
