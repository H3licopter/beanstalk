</h1><p>The entry point for a Beanstalk project is configured when creating a new Beanstalk project. 
This file is called "main.bs" and is placed in an /src folder by default. A configuration file is also created in the root directory.
All Beanstalk files use the .bs file extension.

</p><p>Any Beanstalk file tied into the project can specify compiler settings and the config for your project as long as it is part of, or imported into this main file. 
The compiler will read through any configuration settings first, then it will run any compile time evaluations inside the code.

</p><p>To talk to the compiler and set project configurations, the # symbol is used. 

</p><h1>Project Configuration
</h1><p>When creating a new Beanstalk html project, a configuration file will be created in the root directory. 
This is called "config.bs" by default and it will specify the entry point and structure of the program. 

</p><p>A /media folder will also be created, and an /src folder which will contain the entry point and file structure for your project. 
There is also a /dependencies folder which contains all the libraries and dependencies for your project.

</p><p>Using compiler directives, the config file specifies all the default behavior for the project. 
Most of the compiler directives are objects that already have their structure specified. The config file is also written in Beanstalk and looks a bit like this:

</p><span>#project "html"
    #main "./src/main.bs"
    #title "Definitely not a scam website"
    #url "www.fateorchaos.com"
    #favicons "./media/favicons"
</span><h1>Imports
</h1><p>The import keyword can be accessed from the # symbol and will accept strings to paths for other modules or libraries you want to import into your project. 

</p><span>#import "some_lib_maker/crazy_lib"
</span><p>Beanstalk imports its entire standard library of built in functions by default. 
But you can also exclude the default libraries by using the exclude compiler command. 
You can also use this to bypass the directory based routing of the compiler.

</p><span>#exclude "standard"
</span></main>
